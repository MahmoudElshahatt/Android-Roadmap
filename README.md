# :robot: Android Roadmap
![Android Cover](images/Android%20Cover.png)
A roadmap for android developers that can guide you from the very basics of the track and help you improve your skills.

**First of all, we have to talk about**
## :green_book: Why should you learn Android development?
![Android Devices](images/Android%20Devices.png)
With over 3 billion Android devices all over the world including:
( :iphone: Smartphones,
:tv: TVs,
:watch: Smartwatches,
:car: Cars and more)
in the hands of 2.5 billion users, it has become essential for companies to develop Android apps for their services.

Before starting with Android you have to know about Git and GitHub. *(If you know about them you can skip this section.)*

## Git and GitHub:

First,what is the difference between Git and GitHub?
[See this](https://devmountain.com/blog/git-vs-github-whats-the-difference/)

You can learn about them from these resources:

NOW,you need to know how to use Git and GitHub with Android Studio which provides app builders with an integrated development environment (IDE) optimized for Android apps.

You are ready to start your journey with Android but before starting with Android you have to learn a programming language and because it's Android, we recommend you start learning with Java.

---

## But.. Why Java? :thinking:
- Most the open-source projects are written in Java.
- Java has been the preferred language for Android development until May 2019
- Most of the Stack Overflow answers are written in Java
- Most Android libraries are written in Java, and to be able to use them, you have to understand Java.

## Learning Java:

### :paperclip: Resources:

#### `Arabic:`

1. [Java baiscs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCInYL3l2AajYlZGzU_LVrHdoouf8W6ZN) *(Recommended)*
2. [OOP](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCInYL3l2AagY7fFlhCrjpLiIFybW3yQv)

#### `English (Udacity):`
1. [Java basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/java-programming-basics--ud282)
2. [OOP](https://www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-programming-in-java--ud283)

## Before moving to the next level you have to make sure that you understand these topics:
- Basic syntax
- Conditions (if - switch)
- Looping (for - while - do While)
- Arrays & Collections 
- Exception handling (try-catch)
- OOP
  - Encapsulation
  - Abstraction
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism

## Android basics:
Now you are ready to start programming real Android apps for that you will need a good IDE to help you in your journey and I recommend you use Android studio.

Then you will need to learn how to reuse portions of your app's UI by using fragments and navigation component.

### :paperclip: Resources:
* Fragments: [Arabic Next Trend](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL25WpelterbakuEfYt-G-TzzzzIOAZQbK)

## Before moving to the next level you have to make sure that you understand these topics:
- Design responsive android UI using XML
- Accepting user inputs
- Developing multi-screen applications

## Kotlin:
After building a strong foundation with java and XML basics we will start building on it with the knowledge we will really use in our future applications.

![Kotlin](images/Kotlin.png)
### So... Why Kotlin?
After Google I/O 2017 where Google announced first-class support for Kotlin on Android, Kotlin has become used by more and more Android developers and now it's used by over 60% of professional Android developers, for that each Android developer must learn it. [Learn More](https://developer.android.com/kotlin)

We will start by learning the basics of the language.

## What to do Next? :thinking:
**`once you stop learning you start dying`**

You have to continue learning more and more and try to be always up-to-date with the new technologies coming to the field.

You can follow [Android Developers](https://www.youtube.com/c/AndroidDevelopers) YT Channel and watch their [MAD Skills](https://www.youtube.com/c/AndroidDevelopers/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=5) series to stay up-to-date.
